# Emoji-Prediction-CNN

About the Dataset
The FER2013 dataset ( facial expression recognition) consists of 48*48 pixel grayscale face images. The images are centered and occupy an equal amount of space. This dataset consist of facial emotions of following categories:

0:angry
1:disgust
2:feat
3:happy
4:sad
5:surprise
6:natural


***********************************************************************************************




I builded a CNN architecture to classify facial
expressions from images in the dataset and
trained the model to predict corresponding emojis(available in the
dataset) & saved the model weights .

Detecting the bounding boxes of face in the webcam and predict the emotions is still in progress , & I am Planning to work on its GUI part as well using tkinter .
